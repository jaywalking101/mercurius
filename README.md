_An angular notification module_

First things first: checkout the demo at http://anzol.biz/mercurius.

So, the history so far: I was looking for a tool to show notifications in an app I am writing using angular (and bootstrap). Essentially, a way to show bootstrap alerts as fixed elements centered top and bottom and in the page corners.

I found bootstrap-growl (https://github.com/ifightcrime/bootstrap-growl), but I was looking for something more angular-ish. Then I found angular-growl (https://github.com/marcorinck/angular-growl) and angular-notify (https://github.com/cgross/angular-notify).

They both seem nice, but not exactly what I was looking for (things hardly are, anyway).

I decided to write my own directive. I soon realized there would be a service to handle things and that everything would fit quite nicely in a module.

Right now it is good enough for myself. It has a very simple api and should be easy to use and understand. At the end it was mostly an oportunity to learn a lot more about directives, modules, provider and a few other angular crazy interesting stuff and way to achieve things. =)

## How to Use It

You'll will have to link the css file and the js file (that is the module itself):

    <link
        href="js/modules/mercurius/mercurius.css"
        rel="stylesheet"
        >

    <script
        src="js/modules/mercurius/mercurius.js"
        >
    </script>

Put mercurius in your main module dependencies and configure the template url (the path to mercurius.html):

    angular
        .module('demo', [
            'ngAnimate',
            'ngSanitize',
            'mercurius'
        ])
        .config(function config(mercuriusProvider) {
            mercuriusProvider.configuration.notifier.templateUrl = 'js/modules/mercurius/mercurius.html';
        })


Then you'll inject the mercurius service wherever you need it, like in the provided demo:

```javascript
.controller('demo', function demoController($scope, random, mercurius) {
```

And, finally, use it!:

```javascript
mercurius('Greendale Community College rules!', {
    dismissable: true,
    location: 'topMiddle',
    timeout: 4000,
    type: 'warning',
    width: 'auto'
});
```

The above example uses the default values for the configuration object.

This project was a great oportunity to learn and also give back to the community. I hope someone else finds it useful in the long run. Most feedback is welcome! =D
